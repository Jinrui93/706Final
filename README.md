# 706Final

In this project, we are interested in the visualization of COVID-19. We use the dataset "US Counties COVID-19 + Weather + Socio/Health Data” published on Kaggle with comprehensive data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in various counties, as well as information on related weather patterns, social indicators, and health statistics, providing a unique opportunity to understand the impact of different factors on the spread of COVID-19. During the pandemic, counties of the United States span a diverse range of social, economic, health, and weather conditions. Because of the COVID19 pandemic, more than 2000 counties have already experienced some COVID19 cases. The data was collected and aimed to identify which populations are at risk of COVID-19 and help prepare high-risk communities. Each observations included in the dataset was collected on a daily basis in each county. The dataset used in the visualization tasks is the subset of the original large full dataset according to the questions that are trying to answer.

All codes deployed on StreamLit is stored in `streamlitApp_combined.py` for visualization tasks. Here is the link guiding to the StreamLit application: https://jinrui93-706final-streamlitapp-combined-dicvxm.streamlit.app/. 

The date ranges from 2020-01-21, when the first COVID-19 case was detected in the US, to 2020-12-04. Only the dates and corresponding counties when there was at least 1 case in the county are included. There are a total of 318 dates, more than 2400 counties, and 791582 data points in the COVID-19 dataset. Originally, there were 227 daily features and 181 county-level features. In our dataset, we target a subset of the features. Specifically, we will target COVID-19 features, including the number of COVID-19 cases, the number of COVID-19 deaths, and percent vaccinated. All of the COVID-19 features are in quantitative form. Besides, we include county-level weather features–average temperature, humidity, and wind speed, socioeconomic features– median household income, poverty rate, percent insured, and health indicators–smoking habits, obesity, diabetes, and sleep patterns. All of the county-level features are in quantitative form.
